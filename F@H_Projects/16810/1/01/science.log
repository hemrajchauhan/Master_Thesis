The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
GROMACS was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding GROMACS with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable. GPU update with domain decomposition lacks substantial testing and should be used with caution.
Changing nstlist from 20 to 100, rlist from 1.205 to 1.32


Update task on the GPU was required, by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable, but the following condition(s) were not satisfied:

Either PME or short-ranged non-bonded interaction tasks must run on the GPU.
Compatible GPUs must have been found.
Only a CUDA build is supported.
The number of coupled constraints is higher than supported in the CUDA LINCS code.

Will use CPU version of update.
