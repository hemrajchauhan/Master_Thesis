The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
GROMACS was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding GROMACS with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable. GPU update with domain decomposition lacks substantial testing and should be used with caution.
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 1 to 1.111


Update task on the GPU was required, by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable, but the following condition(s) were not satisfied:

Either PME or short-ranged non-bonded interaction tasks must run on the GPU.
Compatible GPUs must have been found.
Only a CUDA build is supported.
Only the md integrator is supported.
The number of coupled constraints is higher than supported in the CUDA LINCS code.

Will use CPU version of update.
