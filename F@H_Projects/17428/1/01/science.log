Compiled SIMD instructions: AVX_256 (Gromacs could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better)

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
GROMACS was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding GROMACS with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=OFF CMake option.


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin thread to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
